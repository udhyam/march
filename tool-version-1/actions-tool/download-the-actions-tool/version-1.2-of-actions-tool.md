# âš’ Version 1.2 of Actions Tool

Based on the initial learnings, we have designed a Version 1.2 of the Actions Tool that is not yet tested. It needs more input, research and testing support.&#x20;

<summary>Changes in Version 1 to Version 1.2</summary>

**Change 1**

From experts and learner feedback, particularly regarding response options in Part A, we have implemented a significant improvement by updating the Likert scale options completely to ensure a more accurate and balanced assessment.\
\
In the initial version, the response choices were more skewed towards 'positive / yes' response.

* **Version 1**
  * (a) yes, many times
  * (b) yes, sometimes
  * (c) yes, once or twice
  * (d) no

<!---->

* **Version 1.2**
  * (a) No, never
  * (b) Almost never
  * (c) Sometimes
  * (d) Almost always
  * (e) Yes, always

We switched from a 4 point to 5 point Likert scale, as various research publications, including those from Stanford (Krosnick & Presser, 2010), suggest that a 5-point scale is considered optimal.

**Change 2**

Previously, in Version 1, Question 10 of the tool had a binary response format with only "Yes" or "No" options. In the updated Version 1.2 tool, we have introduced the above-mentioned Likert scale, which provides a more comprehensive set of response options. This modification ensures that all 20 items in the tool share a consistent and improved Likert scale for a more detailed and accurate assessment.&#x20;

Advantages of 5-point Likert scale:

* Psychometric Properties: Five-point Likert scales exhibit good psychometric properties, including reliability and validity in measuring attitudes and perceptions.
* Response Distribution: The scale provides a sufficient range of response options, preventing response clustering and allowing for a more nuanced understanding of participants' opinions.
* Normal Distribution Assumption: Fits well with the assumption of normal distribution in statistical analyses, facilitating parametric tests.
* Efficient Analysis: Easier to analyze statistically due to its ordinal nature, making it compatible with various statistical methods like t-tests and ANOVA.
* Reduced Acquiescence Bias: Compared to scales with fewer response options, a five-point Likert scale reduces the likelihood of respondents exhibiting acquiescence bias by simply agreeing with statements.
* Cross-Cultural Applicability: Research suggests that five-point scales are less susceptible to cultural biases and variations, making them more universally applicable across diverse populations.
