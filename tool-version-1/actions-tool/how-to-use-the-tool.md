# ⚙ How to use the Tool

**Important**

* Self-administered Tool
* Can be used as a survey, or as a Baseline and Endline assessment.

***

_**Please Note**:_&#x20;

* _Given that the Version 1 Actions questionnaire is a tool-in-development, there are no benchmarks for analysis. It will be important for programme teams (ops and curriculum) and M\&E to work together to make sense of, and validate, these findings based on ground realities as well as observation- based experiences._
* _If the tool is utilized both before and after a program, its current validation may not be sufficient to definitively attribute changes to the program. However, it can still indicate whether a change has occurred or not. In this context, we recommend employing the Fisher's Exact test._ \

**Data, Insights & Future Research**

This tool offers the opportunity to:

* Gain actionable insights for internal purposes (e.g. Curriculum design, post-program engagement); for example, data indicating that learners “wanted to, but did not have the opportunity” to try public-speaking could lead to pivots in program design that create space for these opportunities.
* Conduct further qualitative research based on findings to understand specific mindsets, actions and barriers
* Potentially collect objective observer data by having peers, parents or teachers fill out the tool and triangulate learner data
* Research learner actions at a large scale and publish findings to build ecosystem knowledge, learnings and collaborations; this will include combining and comparing findings from across a variety of locations in India.

**Analysis & Reporting**

* At the student level, it is possible to analyse the actions they have taken, including their frequency, and to understand the reasons behind actions they may not have undertaken.&#x20;
* It is also possible to do an in-depth analysis of responses by gender, district and other demographics.&#x20;
* Shifts in action responses from baseline to endline can also be calculated.

**PART A**

* (a) yes, many times - **The more an action is performed, the higher the likelihood of a particular mindset being present.**&#x20;

* (c) yes, once or twice
* (d) no - **The lesser an action is performed, the lower the likelihood of a particular mindse being present.**

**PART B**

* (a) did not need to - **No compulsion**&#x20;
* (b) did not want to - **No interest**&#x20;
