# ⚡ Actions Tool

The [Version 1 of MARch Actions tool](download-the-actions-tool/) is a 20-item, fun, self reported and learner-centric questionnaire.&#x20;

It aims to understand real-world actions being taken by youth. In addition, the tool also tries to understand why a certain action may not have been taken, to paint a clearer picture of the environment and barriers faced by our learners. The questionnaire uses Udhyam’s mindsets of grit, trying new things, self- awareness and independent decision-making as an underlying framework.

We rolled out the tested tool and have gathered **70,000+ students data from across 5 states in India**. These states include Delhi, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh, and Kerala. The data included 70,000+ quantitative data and also 30,000+ qualitative data we gathered from learners to understand the context behind their responses on the actions tool.

The tool was translated into 4 Indian local languages to ensure inclusivity and ease of use - Hindi, Telugu, Punjabi and Malayalam.

We gathered data as pre and post, with 3-8 months gap to assess if there have been changes in the actions of students and if the tool is able to record them. During post, we also asked students to share examples of their actions. From the data gathered, the tool was tested for initial Reliability and Validity.

<summary>Dashboard and Significance Tests</summary>

We developed an internal data dashboard with real-time updates and interactive features, providing a user-friendly interface for stakeholders.&#x20;

In order to investigate hypotheses and explore Action responses, we utilised the Fisher Exact test. This statistical test is employed to ascertain whether there are nonrandom associations between two categorical variables, specifically the significance of actions. In other words, we aimed to assess whether the changes in the 1st and 2nd rounds of actions reported by students, whether positive or negative, exhibit significant differences or are negligible. Most changes were significant.

**The Actions Tool has 2 Parts**

* Part A questions ask the learner whether or not they have done a particular action – response options aim to understand frequency and include: (a) yes, many times, (b) yes, sometimes, (c) yes, once or twice, (d) no.&#x20;
* If the learner chooses "no", they are offered four options in Part B: (a) did not need to, (b) did not want to, (c) wanted to but did not have the opportunity, (d) was not allowed (by family / caregiver / teacher).&#x20;

**Two Variants of the Actions Tool**&#x20;

* The school version of the Actions Tool is designed for students aged 14-18 attending school.&#x20;
* The ITI version of the Actions Tool is tailored for students aged 18 and above, enrolled in ITI or Industrial Training Institute (Vocational Studies) programmes.

**Student’s Voice**

“The questions I was asked in this questionnaire made me realize how much I improved throughout the years. I have almost done everything from this questionnaire. I lead my group in different activities in school and outside of it many times. I tried new things and even argued with my parents/teachers and people from my surrounding a gazillion of times, so that I can try and achieve whatever I needed to...Lastly, I'm glad that this questionnaire had really good questions to ask, as it made me rewind all the things I've done. It made me feel that I'm worthy of being a better person. Thank-you ”&#x20;
