# ðŸ”’ Limitations of the tool

**Feedback recieved**:

Experts and practitioners have provided valuable feedback on improving the Tool's reliability and validity and also its overall design. Their suggestions include simplifying the questions and enhancing the Likert scale responses to ensure a more effective evaluation.

* One notable concern was the complexity of many questions, which encompassed multiple themes, potentially leading to difficulties in comprehension and scoring. The experts recommend focusing each question on a single theme in the updated Tool Design, which is a key area of improvement.
* In the Version 1 tool, questions were presented as queries to students, but experts advise transforming them into statements for a more precise assessment.
* Furthermore, the current response format featuring four positive options and one extreme negative option may introduce response bias. To address this issue, the recommendation is to rebalance the rating scale for more accurate and unbiased feedback.
