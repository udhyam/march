# üîç Reliability and Validity Testing

**What is Reliability and Validity?**

Reliability test measures the consistency and stability of the assessment tool, while the validity test measures the accuracy and relevance of the assessment tool.

{% hint style="info" %}
Based on the initial learnings, we have designed a Version 1.2 of the Actions Tool that is not yet tested. It needs more input, research and testing support.&#x20;
