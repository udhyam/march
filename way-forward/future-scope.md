# ðŸš€ Future Scope

Imagine a world where the Actions Tool becomes a powerful force for youth empowerment and a driver of positive change. In this future:

* **Empowering Youth:** The Actions Tool will empower young people nationally, offering them equal opportunities to showcase their abilities and reach their full potential.
* **National Benchmark:** It will evolve into the ASER for Youth, setting a national benchmark for assessing youth skills, readiness, and real world actions.
* **Influencing Policy:** The tool will inform policymaking at district, state, and national levels, driving decisions that better support youth development.
* **Personal Learning Credential:** Our goal is to transform the Actions Tool into a recognized Personal Learning Credential, authenticating and opening doors to a world of opportunities for young people.
* **Unlocking Opportunities:** With this credential, young people will unlock employment, education, and mentorship opportunities, ensuring a brighter future for all.

We want to learn and co-create this project with the impact community. Amazing organizations around us are involved in various similar efforts. We aspire to create a community that can together learn, share and co-create, and progress the mission of building more powerful measurement tools to empower our youth.
