**As youth transition beyond academic learning, their ability to interact with the real world becomes a key driver of success.**

Here, we mean that the ability to interact encompasses youth competencies, doing abilities or real-world actions.&#x20;

In 2016, a Guardian interview noted, ‚Äúevery month, for the next several years, 1 million Indians will turn 18‚Äù.\[1] With over 50% of India's population under 30 and a rapidly growing youth demographic, traditional education systems face challenges in preparing individuals for real-world success.

**Context and Challenges**

Our education boards such as the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), and various state education boards, prescribe knowledge (and some skill) requirements through school curricula. As a result, our learning systems have historically measured what and how much students know \[3] \[4]

Most organisations, parents, and society continue to value educational qualification milestones as a proxy for capability, more than evidence of actual mindsets, knowledge and skills.

Importantly, these learning systems do not prescribe what a young person should ideally be able to do and how the quality and quantity of that doing can be measured.

<summary>What are Real World Actions in the Indian Context?</summary>

Studies have indicated that a majority of Indian youth are aware that a key requirement for army recruitment is fitness. They not only understand what a fitness requirement is but are also able to visualise and quantify it, which motivates them to work towards achieving this goal.

Similarly, a significant portion of rural Indian youth believes that 'English speaking' is an essential skill for securing good job opportunities. Just like with fitness, they have a clear understanding of the importance of this skill, can envision its benefits, and actively strive to improve it.

However, just as fitness and English proficiency are crucial, there are other critical actions that hold significance but may not be explicitly articulated.

For instance, 'mobility' as an action, as highlighted by the [World Bank](https://blogs.worldbank.org/endpovertyinsouthasia/shaping-womens-access-opportunities-gender-transport-and-employment-mumbai), plays a pivotal role in shaping the lives of women, in India, differently from men. The lack of access to transportation and mobility significantly impacts women's ability to access public services, such as education and healthcare. In turn, this lack of access affects their participation in markets, employment, and skills development, influencing not only their personal quality of life but also that of their families. \[To learn more, refer to this [study conducted in Mumbai](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/75acd608-327c-597a-ac9d-ddbd9e3a1285/content) on this subject.]

India‚Äôs economy is predominantly informal (over 90%). With no formal contracts, guaranteed worker rights and benefits, including, social security - workers operate in uncertain job scenarios and have no clear career path. There is no real way to track and assess their capabilities nor the necessary real-world actions they need to cultivate.&#x20;

In the formal sector, more than a third of global companies report difficulties in filling open positions owing to a shortage of people with key skills.\[5] Even for industries now, 'doing' matters more than just 'knowing'.
