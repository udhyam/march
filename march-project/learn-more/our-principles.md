_MARch asks questions like: “Have you failed at doing something but kept trying and eventually made progress?”, “Have you taught yourself or independently learned a new skill?”_&#x20;

</details>

* **Youth Centricity**: We engage young individuals, keeping them at the center of our efforts, and create spaces for them to play an active role in decision-making and problem-solving. We strive to design tools that are accessible and equitable.

_With MARch, we actively included young people in designing the tool. We started by getting their input, then tested prototypes with small groups in different States. This helped ensure the questions were relevant and easy to understand._

* **Non-Judgemental:** We believe in creating inclusive tools where youth feel valued and respected, regardless of their backgrounds, beliefs, or experiences.&#x20;

_Within our innovative tool, our focus extended beyond merely tracking the actions of youth. We placed empathy at the core of the tool by introducing a novel element—inquiring with youth about the reasons behind their inaction, if applicable. For example, while most tools only assess if something is taking place or not, we go a step beyond and try to understand why something is not taking place to understand the context and barriers. On the Part-B section of our tool, we ask learners, why they did not do the actions_

* **Open Source**: Embracing open source principles, we promote collaboration, community participation, and innovation to ensure accessibility for all.
