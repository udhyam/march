# üîê Udhyam's Context

**The Need for the Action Tool**

Udhyam Learning Foundation primarily works with youth to foster their entrepreneurial mindsets. Over the last 5+ years, we have worked with close to 3 million students across India, in partnership with 10+ state governments.&#x20;

What did we want to assess?&#x20;

During the course of our journey, we have used various assessment methods and tools, to understand our own programme‚Äôs impact on the students we serve, and more importantly, the significance of our impact on the child‚Äôs real world.&#x20;

The focus is on unlocking entrepreneurial mindsets by nurturing 4 key mindsets - grit, trying new things, independence and self-awareness. Primarily, we have tried to decode if students are applying what they are learning.

Example: A student saying "I know how to code in Java" is relatively less convincing as compared to them actually having written multiple Java programs.

<summary>What is an Entrepreneurial Mindset?</summary>

Udhyam defines an entrepreneurial mindset as a way of thinking that is focused on identifying and taking advantage of opportunities. People with this mindset are typically creative, resourceful, and willing to take risks. They are also able to learn from their mistakes and pivot their approach when necessary.

**How did we assess Entrepreneurial Mindsets?**&#x20;

We used both qualitative and quantitative approaches. For qualitative data, we undertook one-on-one interviews and focus group discussions.  We also employed facilitator-led observation tools. For our quantitative research, we used survey instruments, peer feedback forms and psychometric tools. (Psychometric tools are standardised instruments designed to measure and quantify psychological attributes, abilities, or traits, such as personality, attitudes, intelligence, or skills).

However‚Ä¶

While psychometric assessment provided some indication, we wanted to explore ways of measuring mindset shifts and change in real-world actions with more conviction. There is research to back this too, the use of psychometric tools in developing countries faces challenges related to cultural adaptation, language barriers, limited resources, and the need for context-specific norms. \[8] \[9]

These conversations and internal discussions paved the way for the MARch Project Actions Tool - an effort to identify and develop more convincing methods of assessing individual mindsets and actions.
