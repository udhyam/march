# üóù MARch Actions Tool

Currently in its Version 1 stage, MARch‚Äôs Action Tool focuses on tangible actions, ensuring user-friendliness, scalability, and youth-centricity. By engaging young individuals in the design process, MARch strives to create inclusive and equitable tools that reflect the diverse backgrounds and experiences of youth.

The tool, currently available in multiple languages, has already gathered data from over 70,000 students across five states in India.

Early insights from the tool reveal intriguing patterns in youth actions, such as leadership role opportunities and gender-specific behaviours.&#x20;

The MARch team envisions a future where the Actions Tool becomes a powerful force for youth empowerment, setting a national benchmark and influencing policy decisions. The ultimate goal is to transform the tool into a recognised Personal Learning Credential, unlocking opportunities for young people in education, employment, and mentorship.

At this stage in the initiative, MARch recognises that for the Action Tool to be truly effective and inclusive it will have to be co-nurtured and adopted by multiple ecosystem partners. This includes all of you - youth, individuals, organisations, research outfits, government stakeholders, and other allies - who are invested in ensuring a better future for India and her youth. We invite you to [join our efforts](../../way-forward/reach-out-to-us.md) in contributing to the design of the Action Tool and helping scale this initiative.
