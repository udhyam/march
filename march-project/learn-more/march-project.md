# üìù MARch Project

The Mindsets Action Research \[MARch] project addresses this gap by recognising that a young person's ability to take meaningful actions is a crucial determinant of success, especially as they transition beyond academic learning.

The project aims to define and convincingly measure what youth are able to ‚Äúdo‚Äù in the real world ‚Äì encompassing the dimensions of mindsets, knowledge and skills contextually within the realities of a developing country.&#x20;

Our key deliverable for this project is to create a host of measurement tools \[MARch Actions Tools] that can aid diverse stakeholders including students / youth themselves, educators, development practitioners, academicians, policymakers and others to measure youth‚Äôs real-world actions to be used in diverse contexts such as designing new youth interventions, career development, policy formulation, curriculum enhancement, and recruitment.

This effort aligns with the progressive approach of the National Curriculum Framework for School Education 2023, proposed by the Government of India. This new framework recognises these existing gaps and proposes a pedagogy and assessment model that places greater emphasis on individuals' competencies (doing ability), over knowledge.\[7]

**Our Hypotheses**

* H1 - The success of youth in the real world is positively correlated with their capacity to take real-world actions.
* H2 - The MARch Actions Tool demonstrates superior efficacy in gauging and evaluating individual mindsets and actions when compared to conventional methodologies.
* H3 - Implementing the MARch Actions Tool as an ASER (Annual Status of Education Report) for youth has the potential to significantly influence policy and other stakeholder decisions, and increase community awareness, thereby contributing to positive societal impact.&#x20;

The MARch team envisions a future where the Actions Tool becomes a powerful force for youth empowerment, setting a national benchmark and influencing policy decisions. The ultimate goal is to transform the tool into a recognised Personal Learning Credential, unlocking opportunities for young people in education, employment, and mentorship.

At this stage in the initiative, MARch recognises that for the Action Tool to be truly effective and inclusive it will have to be co-nurtured and adopted by multiple ecosystem partners. This includes all of you - youth, individuals, organisations, research outfits, government stakeholders, and other allies - who are invested in ensuring a better future for India and her youth. We invite you to [join our efforts](../../way-forward/reach-out-to-us.md) in contributing to the design of the Actions Tool and helping scale this initiative.
