description: Measuring Youth Actions
---

# üßä Overview

The Mindsets Action Research \[MARch] project aims to define and convincingly measure what youth are able to ‚Äúdo‚Äù in the real-world ‚Äì encompassing the dimensions of mindsets, knowledge and skills.&#x20;

We are developing tools to measure real world actions of youth in India, and the first version is ready. Data has been gathered from over 70,000+ students across India and the tool has been translated into 4 Indian Languages - Hindi, Punjabi, Telugu and Malayalam.

We believe MARch has the potential to create impact at multiple levels of social value. Our research aims to make the ‚Äúmeasurement of doing‚Äù an enabler for various use cases and contribute evidence to the education and youth development ecosystem by capturing learner voices and contextually-rich actions that matter to the world.&#x20;
